# TOP-Project-Landing-Page

Reflections upon completion of the project:
-I'm feeling good about my progress in TOP, I was able to achieve this project more quickyl and efficiently than I thought I would. 
-It was easier to complete this project than it was to complete the CSS exercises.
-I wish the header wouldn't scale beyond a certain width but I can't figure out to achieve that without limiting the background color of the header using the "space-between" command in flexbox 
-TOP has been fantastic so far, hoping to keep pushing through and learning.
